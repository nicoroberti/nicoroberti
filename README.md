ðŸš¢ðŸ’» From international trade routes to clean, well-tested code.

Iâ€™m a Logistics Specialist with over 15 years of experience optimizing logistics operations, developing domestic transport strategies, and managing cargo consolidation. Along the way, I discovered that what I truly enjoy is solving complex problems and improving processes.

That curiosity recently led me into the world of technology. I completed a QA Engineer bootcamp, and today Iâ€™m ready to apply my skills in both manual and automated testing, with knowledge of Python, Selenium, JSON, Android Studio, Postman, Jira, and other tools.

Iâ€™m passionate about learning, building bridges between industries, and bringing an analytical and structured mindsetâ€”both from a logistics and a tech perspective.

ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s next? Joining a team where I can contribute high-quality solutions, continue growing, and combine the best of both worlds: global operations experience and a software quality mindset.

ðŸ“¬ Iâ€™m open to new opportunities and connections in QA, testing, or tech roles where I can make a difference!
